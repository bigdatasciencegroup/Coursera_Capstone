Photos, tips and reviews jolted by Foursquare users can also be used in many productive ways to add value to the results. \n\n1.- Query the FourSqaure website for the top sites in Washington DC.  \n2.- Use the FourSquare API to get supplemental geographical data about the top sites  \n3.- Use the FourSquare API to get top restaurent recommendations closest to each of the top site  \n4.- Use open source Chicago Crime data to provide the user with additional crime data  \n\n\n## Workflow\n\n- Web Scraping and Data Wrangling    \n- Top Trending Places  \n- Extraction and Clustering  \n- Decision Making based on the clustered neighborhoods, Population Distribution, School Ratings, Median House Price Analysis \n- Above, we have done convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values.\n- Then we will use the Foursquare API to explore neighbourhoods\n- After that, explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighbourhood, and then use this feature to group the neighbourhoods into clusters\n\nK-means clustering algorithm will be using to complete this task. And the Folium library to visualize the neighbourhoods in Mumbai and Pune and their emerging clusters.\n\n",
