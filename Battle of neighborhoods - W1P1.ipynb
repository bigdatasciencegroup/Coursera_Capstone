Because of this, they are going to pay me an Executive Master in Business Administration, at the Georgetown University (Washington DC).  \n\nFor this reason, my family and me will have to move to Washintong. So we have to decide which neighborhood is the best according with our needs and likes.  \n\nWe shall use several tools to validate the best neighborhood; checking relevant data like housing prices, incoming rates, population distribution, school ratings, hospital ratings, distance to the University, trending venues...  \n\nIdentifying and understanding the similarities and differences between two chosen neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude with ease which neighborhood wins over other.  \n\nUnderstanding the similarities and differences between the neighborhoods using Unsupervised K-Mean Clustering Algorithm.  \n\n**Georgetown University:**\n![GC](https://washington-org.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/article_hero_breakpoints_theme_washington_lg_1x/public/3832348182_a700a0e6dc_o.jpg?itok=MmkEuDyW&timestamp=1465423569 \"Georgetown University Campus\")\n\n",
